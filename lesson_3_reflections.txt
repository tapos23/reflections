When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When i want to share my work.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because may be some changes i'm doing is for experiment or for a different version.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch creates a different path to experiment with the master code. Clone makes a wxact copy of repository. Fork is like a clone just done in a GitHub platform.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
Stay up to date with the work.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I can collaborate using google drive or email. GitHub is easier.
